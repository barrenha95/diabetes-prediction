## Frequently questions
### What types of diabetes exist?
- T1D (Type 1 Diabetes): Is an autoimune disease which makes the imunologic system attacks the beta cells of pancreas by mistake. We still don't know why that happens but it makes our body fail in the insulin production.
- T2D (Type 2 Diabetes): This type of diabetes exists when the body can generate insulin but the cells can't use it properly. This condition is what we call as "Resistance to insulin".
- Gestational: It's the high blood sugar disorder that is developed during pregnancy, most of the times it ends after the pregnancy (Some people can developt T2D after).

### What is insulin?
Insulin is the hormone responsible to manage the gate between the blood flow and the cells, in other words is the responsible of letting sugar enter in cells.

### What metric we use to measure blood sugar?
Blood sugar (or Blood Glucose in some texts) can be measured by many metrics along the world, all of them are a proportion between how much sugar exists in a given volume of blood.
The most commonly used metric is mg/dl.

## Target Blood Glucose Range
Glycemia (concentration of sugar on blood) can change a lot along the day, because of that the medical comunnity usually uses what we call as "Target Blood Glucose Range".
The Target Blood Glucose Range is a range of blood sugar values that is recommended to have in order to avoid health disorders.

### How a Target Blood Glucose Range works?
![Target Blood Glucose Range Example](/src/img/target_blood_glucose_range.png)
The values on the target blood glucose range can change according to personal health conditions (like age, other conditions) because glycemia is something multifactorial.
In the example above the reference value is 100 mg/dl but values between 70 and 180 mg/dl are also in the acceptable range.
It's okay to have highs and lows along the day, because of that is recommended to check the glycemia 4 or 6 times in the day paying attention if at least 50% or 60% of the checkings are in the acceptable range.
The farthest your glycemia is from the desirable range the highest the risks of having medical conditions like:
- Diabetic ketoacidosis (when the glycemia is high)
- Unconsciousness (when the glycemia is low)
- Seizures (when the glycemia is low)
- Death (when the glycemia is low)

### When is recommended to check the glycemia?
Most of times its recommended to check the glycemia in 4 situations:
- When wake up
- 15 minutes before an meal
- Before sleep
- When you fell symptons of change in the blood glucose

The recommended values of glycemia can vary a bit according to those different scenarios. For example:
- Before meals between 90 and 130 mg/dl
- 2 hours after meals under 180 mg/dl
- Overnight between 90 and 150 mg/dl

The formula of this index is:
BMI = Weight (in kilograms) / HeightÂ² (in meters)

This is an continuous feature, but we can have help of a range of values to take some conclusions:
- Below 18.5 = Underweight
- 18.5 - 24.9 = Normal weight
- 25.0 - 29.9 = Overweight
- 30.0 - 34.9 = Obesity class I
- 35.0 - 39.9 = Obesity class II
- Above 40 = Obesity class III
