# Diabetes Prediction

#### -- Project Status: [Active]

## Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to develop a machine learning project since the model development until the deployment on cloud, so in other words: This project has no intention to be productive.
Just to contextualize, the goal is to check if a survey can provide accurate predictions about the probability of an individual have diabetes only using it questions.

### Useful links
* The dataset used on this project can be found on [Diabetes Health Indicator](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alexteboul/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data), I strongly recommend you to visit there to get more context about the business problem.

* I got more business context watching videos of the Michigan Medicine channel on youtube that can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q6rLXPJ6j_I&list=PLNxqP-XbH8BIxZM9bknrNDe3eep5v4zSN).
